## 🚀 Features

- **Custom Dataset Training**  
  Trained YOLOv8 on user-provided images to recognize specific object classes.

- **Real-Time Object Detection**  
  Capable of detecting objects like persons, bicycles, and cars instantly in test images.

- **Easy Testing**  
  Users can input example images to see the model's detection results live.

- **Introductory Computer Vision Project**  
  Designed for learning the fundamentals of object detection with YOLOv8.
